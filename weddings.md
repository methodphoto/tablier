**Please get in touch to arrange a free, no-obligation consultation** to taste cake samples and to discuss your cake design requirements – including budget and number of servings. If you would prefer not to meet in person, I can post cake samples for you to try for a fee of £25 (which will be deducted from your deposit if you decide to book). 

I will supply a written quotation based on the information you give to me, with some rough sketches or reference photos of your preferred ideas. To confirm your project in my schedule, I will require a non-returnable deposit of £50. Detailed design sketches will then be supplied for your approval, including a mood-board with colour and texture samples, if required. 

The balance payment for your cake will be due 14 days before your event. 

From sketches to finished cakes…
