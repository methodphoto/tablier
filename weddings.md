**Feel free to get in touch to arrange a no-obligation consultation** where we can discuss  your cake design and budget, and taste some cake samples.

If meeting in person isn’t convenient, I can also send cake samples by post. Either option requires a £30 fee, which will be deducted from your deposit if you go ahead with a booking.

I will supply a written quotation based on the information you give to me, with some rough sketches or reference photos of your preferred ideas. To confirm your project in my schedule, I will require a non-returnable deposit. Detailed design sketches will then be supplied for your approval, including a mood-board with colour and texture samples, if required. 

The balance payment for your cake will be due 14 days before your event. 

Some examples of my work, from sketches to finished cakes…
