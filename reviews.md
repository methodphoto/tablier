With very short notice, Janette made a spectacular chocolate cake for my daughter’s 21st Birthday. It was exactly what she wanted and was delicious. Highly recommend. It tasted as good as it looked and it looked amazing.<br />

Janette made a lovely cake for my dad’s 90th birthday.  Her attention to detail is amazing.  As he worked in the film industry she made the cake to look like a film reel showing all his interests and hobbies. Not only did it look great it is tasted great.<br />

Janette was so helpful in creating a beautiful two-tier cake for my 30th Birthday. She was very thorough at every point of the process and kept in contact leading up to the cake and cupcakes being made and ready for collection. The cake and cupcakes were delicious and looked stunning! Everyone commented on the taste and the beautiful design of the cake and cupcakes. Thank you so much for all your hard work!!<br />

Highly recommend Janette. She made a 6 tier cake for my wedding which not only looked absolutely stunning but tasted delicious. Unlike many other suppliers who when you mention ‘wedding’ seem to increase their price Janette gave me lots of different options which highlights her passion for her job. She was professional from the start and always went out of her way to give me samples. Thank you Janette.<br />

I had the pleasure of Janette making my wedding cake for me, was recommended by a friend and was so happy, not only did it taste absolutely amazing but the attention to the detail of my cake was out of this world! Janette was so helpful when I gave her a idea of what I wanted, she came back with a amazing design! I had a 3 tier wedding cake with figurines of myself and my husband sat on the side of the cake, weddings can be stressful but Janette made this process a joy, she also bought the cake over to my venue on the day to set up, when seeing it blew us both away, my guest couldn't stop taking about how amazing it was and tasted, I would highly recommend Janette to anyone and most certainly be using her again for future cakes, thank you so much.<br />

After searching high and low for a cake maker I came across Janette’s Facebook page. Her cakes look professional with lovely attention to detail. Once I’d passed on my brief to her, she was both helpful and informative from start to finish. <br />
I can’t express how glad I am to have found her. The cake she made for my twin daughters’ 21st was stunning.....inside and out and tasted wonderful. <br />
I highly recommend Tablier Cakes. <br />
Thank you Janette! <br />

Janette made a fantastic cake for my parents Diamond wedding celebration. The thought and care that went into the cake was so impressive - Janette made sure that the cake was personalised and created sketches so that we could agree on the end product . I was thrilled with the cake as were my parents.<br />

Janette was amazing from start to finish, she goes above and beyond to make sure her cakes and designs are perfect! Our cakes were a huge hit at our wedding and nothing was too much trouble (even repairing our broken cake topper!). She has an amazing eye for detail, we loved that our cake had a dragon and a moon & star for our half Turkish/Welsh wedding. Thank you again, we will definitely be booking in the future!<br />

Janette made a wonderful 21st birthday cake for me, I showed her a picture of what I wanted but wanted to make some changes to the design, well the finished cake looked and tasted perfect even better than the picture thank you so much Janette. Janette even packed the cake so well as I had to travel miles and still the cake looked wonderful, would highly recommend Tablier Cakes<br />

Janette designed a cake for our Mum's 70th birthday which brilliantly captured what we wanted - it looked amazing and everyone wanted a photo with it! Plus, it was completely delicious: vanilla sponge with buttercream and raspberry jam. Everyone loved it, especially Mum, and it contributed significantly to a wonderful day. Thanks so much for the brilliant work.<br />

Janette created a wonderful cake for my father in law's 84th birthday! The cake was  magnificent! Every single element was absolutely perfect. It was also really delicious! So much much better than a bakery cake. And Janette was a joy to work with! Her complete attention to every detail and her creativity are amazing. The  love and care she puts into her creation is abundantly apparent.  Thank you for making Dad's day truly special!<br />

I asked Tablier Cakes to design a cake for my son's 18th birthday. He was really into computing. So Janette sent me some reference pictures and drawings that she had made (they were beautiful in their own right!!) Janette always comes up with amazing designs and is an amazing cake maker. I would highly recommend her. It was the centre piece of our party and tasted delicious too :))<br />
