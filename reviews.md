Janette made a lovely cake for my dad’s 90th birthday.  Her attention to detail is amazing.  As he worked in the film industry she made the cake to look like a film reel showing all his interests and hobbies. Not only did it look great it is tasted great.<br />

Janette was so helpful in creating a beautiful two-tier cake for my 30th Birthday. She was very thorough at every point of the process and kept in contact leading up to the cake and cupcakes being made and ready for collection. The cake and cupcakes were delicious and looked stunning! Everyone commented on the taste and the beautiful design of the cake and cupcakes. Thank you so much for all your hard work!!<br />

Highly recommend Janette. She made a 6 tier cake for my wedding which not only looked absolutely stunning but tasted delicious. Unlike many other suppliers who when you mention ‘wedding’ seem to increase their price Janette gave me lots of different options which highlights her passion for her job. She was professional from the start and always went out of her way to give me samples. Thank you Janette.<br />

Incredible service wonderful cake 
As soon as I contacted Janette, she was on the brief and created a stunning cake which delighted my wife who was celebrating a significant birthday. <br />
Not just the sugar figures but the gorgeous lemon and poppy seed cake was delicious

I had the pleasure of Janette making my wedding cake for me, was recommended by a friend and was so happy, not only did it taste absolutely amazing but the attention to the detail of my cake was out of this world! janette was so helpful when I gave her a idea of what I wanted, she came back with a amazing design! I had a 3 tier wedding cake with figurines of myself and my husband sat on the side of the cake, weddings can be stressful but janette made this process a joy, she also bought the cake over to my venue on the day to set up, when seeing it blew us both away, my guest couldn't stop taking about how amazing it was and tasted, I would highly recommend janette to anyone and most certainly be using her again for future cakes, thank you so much.<br />

After searching high and low for a cake maker I came across Janette’s Facebook page. Her cakes look professional with lovely attention to detail. Once I’d passed on my brief to her, she was both helpful and informative from start to finish. <br />
I can’t express how glad I am to have found her. The cake she made for my twin daughters’ 21st was stunning.....inside and out and tasted wonderful. <br />
I highly recommend Tablier Cakes. <br />
Thank you Janette!

Janette made a fantastic cake for my parents Diamond wedding celebration. The thought and care that went into the cake was so impressive - Janette made sure that the cake was personalised and created sketches so that we could agree on the end product . I was thrilled with the cake as were my parents.<br />
