## <span id="location">LOCATION AND DELIVERY</span>

I am based in Enfield, North London. For cupcakes and celebration cakes, collection is preferred. Delivery can sometimes be arranged within the local area for a nominal fee, but this depends upon my baking schedule. 

Larger tiered cakes can be delivered and set up at your event venue for a fee of £30 plus my return mileage (and any congestion charges). I have delivered to some wide-ranging locations including Hertfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, Sussex, Hampshire, Devon as well as Central London and London postcodes.
