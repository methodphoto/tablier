Level 2 Food Hygiene, EHO Registered and full public liability insurance. Member of the Sugarcraft Guild.

I’m a very experienced artist and designer and can create most styles of cake for you. I will happily make a range of suggestions based on your brief and budget. My up-to-date cake portfolios can be viewed on my Tablier Cakes [Facebook](http://facebook.com/TablierCakes) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/tabliercakes) pages - I don’t upload many onto this website.

## LOCATION AND DELIVERY

I am based in Enfield, North London. For cupcakes and celebration cakes, collection is preferred. Delivery can sometimes be arranged within the local area for a nominal fee, but this depends upon my baking schedule. 

Larger tiered cakes can be delivered and set up at your event venue for a fee of £30 plus my return mileage (and any congestion charges). I have delivered to some wide-ranging locations including Hertfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, Sussex, Hampshire, Devon as well as Central London and London postcodes.
